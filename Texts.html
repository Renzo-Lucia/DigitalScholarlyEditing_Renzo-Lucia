        <h2>I promessi sposi</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong><i>I promessi sposi</i></strong>, The Betrothed in English, is a historical novel by the Italian writer Alessandro Manzoni, widely considered the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language. <br>
                Originally published in three volumes in 1827, the novel underwent extensive revision before reaching its definitive version, released between 1840 and 1842.</p>
            <p>It is set in the Duchy of Milan in 1628 during Spanish rule and tells a powerful story of unwavering love, as seen in the relationship between Renzo and Lucia and their struggle to reunite and marry despite adversity.<br>
                The novel is acclaimed for its psychological depth and its profound insight into the complexities of the human mind.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the novel is also notable for its vivid and harrowing account of the plague that devastated Milan around 1630. <br>
                Manzoni explores a wide range of themes, including the illusory nature of political power, the injustice inherent in legal systems, and the moral spectrum within the Christian clergy, from the fearfulness of Don Abbondio to the courage and sanctity of figures like Padre Cristoforo and Cardinal Federico Borromeo.</p>

        <h2>Spanish context</h2>
        <h5><strong>Reception of I promessi sposi in Spain and Europe</strong></h5>
        <p>Interest in the European, particularly in Spanish, reception of Alessandro Manzoni’s <i>I promessi sposi</i> emerged from research carried out for the virtual exhibition <i>The Betrothed in Europe and the World</i>, organised by the National Centre for Manzoni Studies. The initiative showcases the bibliographic treasures of <i>Casa Manzoni</i>, with a special focus on <strong>foreign editions of the original 1827 version</strong>, using the <a href="https://www.movio.beniculturali.it/dsglism/IpromessisposiinEuropaenelmondo/it/18/sfoglia-le-edizioni">MOVIO platform</a> , developed by the ICCU and made available by the Italian Ministry of Culture.</p> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5><strong>Catalonia as fertile ground for Manzoni’s novel</strong></h5>
          <p>In Catalonia, <i>I promessi sposi</i> found a receptive cultural environment due to: <br>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Shared ideals</strong>: the patriotic and liberal values of Milanese intellectuals resonated with Catalonia’s own independence aspirations.</li>
              <li><strong>Italian liberal exiles</strong>: after the failed uprisings of 1821, many settled in Spain (and England), engaging with local cultural and journalistic circles that welcomed European literary trends.</li>
              <li><strong>Catalan translators</strong>: local intellectuals actively translated and disseminated works by Italian authors.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <br>
        <p>The first major vehicle for Romantic ideas in Spain was the journal <i>El Europeo</i> (1823–1824), founded by Bonaventura Carles Aribau and enriched by contributions from Ramón López Soler, British scientist Charles Ernest Cook, and Italian exiles Fiorenzo Galli and Luigi Monteggia. <br>
          The presence of Italians in the editorial team played a decisive role in shaping Catalan Romanticism and promoting Manzoni’s work.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5><strong>International success and editorial challenges</strong></h5>
        <p>From its first publication in 1827 (Ventisettana edition), <i>I promessi sposi</i> achieved remarkable international success. However, Manzoni suffered from pirated editions and unreliable translations. <br>
          Versions circulated across France, England, Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands often contained omissions, alterations, or reworkings.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Spain, 19th-century Castilian translations followed the same pattern of changes seen elsewhere in Europe but were further shaped by ideological concerns and censorship, especially in relation to depictions of Spanish rule in Italy and unflattering portrayals of members of the clergy. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5><strong>Spanish translation by Juan Nicasio Gallego - Los novios</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Preceded by the translation of <strong>Félix Enciso Castrillón (1833) - Lorenzo o los prometidos esposos</strong>. It is known as the first Castilian translation, which appeared divided in three volumes.
            Its title is faithful to the original, though less appealing than later versions. Little is known about its production and reception</span></li>
          <li>Gallego was a liberal priest and canon of Seville who translated the novel in Catalonia at the suggestion of Aribau.</li>
          <li>Enormous success: 13 editions by the end of the century.</li>
          <li>More faithful than Castrillón’s version, yet still marked by linguistic and ideological adaptation.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

       <br>
       <p>Some of the main <strong>features of Gallego’s translation</strong>: <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Popular additions</strong>:use of proverbs and idioms giving a local flavor to the dialogue.</li>
        <li><strong>Omission</strong>: removal of entire paragraphs, author’s notes, historical names, and metafictional passages; suppression of critical references to the clergy and Spanish monarchy.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplifications</strong>: condensed descriptions, reduced irony, and streamlined narration.</li></p>
      </ul>
       <br>
       <p>A notable example of mistranslation occurs in chapter XXIII, even if it is not analysed for this project: <br>
        It is where Don Abbondio’s thought <i>“gli avessi maritati”</i> (“if only I had married them”) is rendered as <i>“si se lo habría merecido”</i> (“whether he had deserved it”), changing the meaning entirely.</p>
        <br>
       <p>Reasons for these changes included adapting the text to Spanish Catholic sensibilities, improving readability for a broad audience, and focusing on narrative action rather than metafictional framing.</p>
       <br>
<p>As a consequence, both the Castrillón and Gallego versions departed from strict fidelity to the original in order to make the work more appealing to Spanish readers. Despite the losses in nuance, The Betrothed achieved widespread popularity in Spain thanks to its accessible language, narrative drive, and adaptations to local taste.</p>

        <h2>Los novios</h2>
            <p><strong><i>Los novios</i></strong> is the first Spanish translation of <i>I promessi sposi</i>, published in 1836. It was written by Juan Nicasio Gallego, a Spanish poet, translator, and ecclesiastic figure.</p>
            It was published in Madrid by Imprenta de la Biblioteca Española. Taking <i>I promessi sposi</i> written by Manzoni as a starting point, this novel provides a translation that is faithful in structure, but that reflects stylistic and ideological adaptations.<br>

        <p><span style="background-color: rgb(179, 158, 132)">The novel is set in 17th-century Lombardy, mainly between Lecco, Milan, and the surrounding areas, during the period of Spanish rule. It is a time marked by famine, war, social injustice, and plague. <br>
          In a small village on the shores of Lake Como, Renzo Tramaglino and Lucia Mondella, two humble and deeply in love young people, are about to get married. However, the parish priest Don Abbondio, intimidated by the bravi (thugs) of Don Rodrigo, a powerful nobleman infatuated with Lucia, refuses to perform the ceremony. <br>
          Don Abbondio’s loyal and outspoken housekeeper, Perpetua, witnesses his distress and, as usual, offers her advice with her characteristic frankness. <br>
          Lucia returns home with her mother Agnese, and it is revealed that Don Rodrigo had made a bet with his cousin, Count Attilio: that he would succeed in bringing Lucia to his palace.</span></p>
        <p>Renzo, naive but determined, seeks help from a lawyer, known as the Azzecca-garbugli, who turns him away as soon as he realizes that Renzo is in conflict with someone powerful. Renzo, Lucia, and her mum Agnese then attempt to marry through a legal loophole, with the help of Tonio and Gervaso, but Don Abbondio manages to stop them.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Don Rodrigo orders the abduction of Lucia, but the intervention of the Capuchin friar Father Cristoforo, a key moral and spiritual figure, temporarily prevents it. Renzo, Lucia, and Agnese are forced to flee: Lucia and Agnese take refuge in Monza, hosted by the Nun of Monza, named Gertrude while Renzo goes to Milan, where he ends up caught in the bread riots.</p>
        <p>Renzo, unjustly accused of sedition in Milan, is forced to flee to Bergamo, where he is welcomed by his cousin Bortolo. Meanwhile, Lucia is kidnapped by Griso, Don Rodrigo’s henchman, and taken to the castle of the Unnamed, a feared local lord.</p>
        <p>The Unnamed, deeply shaken by Lucia’s faith and words, and after a pivotal encounter with Cardinal Federico Borromeo, experiences a crisis of conscience and converts to good. He releases Lucia, who finds refuge in a convent in Milan.</p>
        <p>In 1630, a plague struck Lombardy, devastating the region. Renzo travels to Milan to find Lucia. He learns that: Don Rodrigo has contracted the plague and dies alone, abandoned. In the meantime, Lucia is at the Lazzaretto, dedicating herself to caring for the sick.</p>
        <p>Renzo meets Father Cristoforo, who offers him spiritual guidance. Lucia, after hesitating due to a vow of chastity she had made in prayer, ultimately agrees to marry Renzo, receiving a dispensation from the Church.</p>
        <p>Renzo and Lucia return to their now peaceful village. They eventually move to Bergamo, where they begin a new life together as husband and wife. The novel ends with a reflection by Renzo: despite all the pain they endured, their experiences taught them to trust in Divine Providence, to discern good from evil, and to find peace through faith and justice.</p>

        <h2>Some differences among the texts</h2>
        <p>It is important to notice that translation is not only a mere linguistic operation, but a deeply cultural and ideological act. Gallego’s <i>Los Novios</i> is both:
            <ul>
                <li><strong> A mirror of Manzoni’s themes, especially on religion and morality,</strong></li>
                <li><strong> A reinterpretation shaped by Spanish literary tradition and the translator’s own worldview.</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Manzoni</strong> was committed to a <strong>realist style and linguistic clarity</strong>, aiming to unite literary language with spoken Italian.</p>
        <p>Whereas, <strong>Gallego </strong> comes from a tradition of classicist and religious Spanish prose and renders the story with a <strong>more elevated tone</strong>, perhaps at the cost of accessibility and narrative realism. <br>
            In <i>Los Novios</i> he represents the earliest reception of Manzoni in Spain. <br></p>
        <p>Gallego’s novel played a role in introducing Italian historical and religious literature to Spanish readers, influencing literary taste and religious values. <br>
            This is not just translation, but a form of cultural adaptation; it can be seen as both a linguistic and ideological bridge between 19th-century Italian and Spanish Catholic cultures.</p>
        <p>What comes out is that the same story can change meaning across languages, cultures, and ideologies.</p>

      <div class="container section-title" data-aos="fade-up" id="sdatt">
        <h2>Spanish interventions</h2>
        <p>Gallego made several interventions that seem to respond to ideological motivations.</p> <br>
        <p>Focus on the First Chapter: <br>
           <strong>The proclamations against the bravi in Ventisettana are replaced by generic references to various political figures of Milan in the Spanish version</strong>, ruing the historical reconstruction of Manzoni with inaccuracy.</p> <br>
        <p>Gallego followed the <strong>principle of adaptación</strong> using <strong>expressions, archaisms, popular sayings and proverbs</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Perpetua says: <br>
                  <q><i>Basta: ella <strong>ci penserà</strong> questa notte; ma intanto non cominci a farsi male da sé, a rovinarsi la salute; mangi un boccone</i></q> <br>
                    when advising the priest is translated <strong><i>"consultar con la almohada"</i></strong> that refers to the tendency of someone who reflects before acting.</li>
                <li><strong>The popular wisdom of Perpetua</strong>: <br>
                  <q><i>e io ho sempre veduto che a chi sa mostrare i denti, e farsi valere, si porta rispetto</i></q> <br> 
                    <strong>is absorbed into an idiomatic expression in the Spanish version</strong>: <q><i>Y dice bien el refrán que al que se hace de miel las moscas se lo comen.</i></q></li>
            </ul>
        <p>Gallego’s intervention gave the novel a <strong>linguistic form</strong> that is <strong>responsible for the book’s popular success</strong>.</p>
