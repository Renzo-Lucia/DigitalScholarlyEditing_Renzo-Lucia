      <p>This project provides a clear and straightforward visual and graphical comparison of two carefully selected texts.</p>

      <p>The focus is on <strong>the first chapter of I Promessi Sposi by Alessandro Manzoni and the first chapter of Los Novios by Gallego</strong>.</p>

      <p>You can explore the full text of the first chapter of <button class="btn-base btn-animato" id="buttonone"><a href="visuaipsoutput.html" target="_blank">the first chapter of I Promessi Sposi</a></button><br> 
        as well as the full text of<button class="btn-base btn-animato" id="buttonone"><a href="visualnoutput.html" target="_blank">the first chapter of Los Novios</a></button></p><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      <p>A close examination of Chapter 1 reveals two immediate and notable differences: the length of the texts and the images.<br>
        The first chapter of I Promessi Sposi extends over 36 pages, whereas Los Novios contains only 20 pages. <br>
        The first chapter of Los novios includes four images that correspond to an addition with respect to the original italian text.
      </p> 
        <br>
       <p>Another striking distinction lies in the use of imagery.<br>
       The Italian text, I Promessi Sposi, which serves as the primary reference for this project, includes no graphic illustrations.<br>
       In contrast, the Spanish version by Gallego, composed later between 1836-37, features numerous graphic representations.<br></p>
      <br>
      <br>
       <p>To faithfully present a digital edition that respects the original works as closely as possible, the <span style=" background-color: gray;">division by pages and line breaks</span> has been carefully preserved. <br>
       Additionally, the texts highlight certain elements for easier recognition and understanding:</p>
       <br>
       <div>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: darkblue;">Names of the characters</span> apperars in bold and in blue color, <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0C9F43;">Sites and places </span> are shown in bold as well and in green color, <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #DC19A3;">dates </span> are ephasized in bold and in pink color.
       </div>
       <br>
      <p>This color-coding helps readers quickly identify these key components in both texts and better appreciate the differences between the original and its translation.<br></p>
      <p>All the technical aspects are better explained in the <a href="workflowanddoc.html">workflow and documentation section</a></p>
      <p>You can easily observe these differences side by side through the provided <button class="btn-base btn-animato" id="buttonone"><a href="output.html" target="_blank">comparison of the two texts</a></button></p>

      <p>To wrap up, I designed what I call the <em>improved comparison</em>: a richer, more interactive version of the simple comparison.
    Instead of just laying two texts side by side, this tool invites the user to explore, discover, and even play with the differences
    and similarities between Manzoni’s <em>I promessi sposi</em> (1827) and its Spanish translation. 
    <br>
    <br>
    At the top left, a color-coded legend guides the reader through the experience: <br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: darkblue;">Bold Blue</span> highlights the names of characters, together with their many variations and their Spanish equivalents.
        So when Don Abbondio appears in Italian as D. Abbondio, curato, or simply Abbondio, all are marked in blue — just as in Spanish,
        where he becomes Don Abundo, D. Abundo, or cura.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #0C9F43;">Bold Green</span> marks the names of places, from rivers to cities, along with their Spanish renderings.
       The Adda river, for instance, turns into <em>río Ada</em> but keeps the same green emphasis</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #DC19A3;">Bold Pink</span> is for dates, whether they specify a full day, month, and year, or just a single year.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: gray; text-decoration: underline wavy gray;">Bold Gray and underlined with a wavy line</span> flags those tricky words that are blurred or damaged in the source editions. They are underlined with a wavy line to warn the reader.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #3399ff; background-color: #cce6ff;">Added images</span> are emphasized through a light blue rectangular box. Wherever the Spanish edition contains an illustration, a light blue placeholder reading <em>“Added image”</em> appears,
      reminding us of the missing visuals in the Italian version. </li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    As repeatedly mentioned, the reference text is the original I Promessi sposi written by Manzoni in 1827. Based on this, you can see that the comparison doesn’t stop at colors. It also tracks the translator’s choices:
  </p>
    <ul> 
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: hsl(50, 85.50%, 48.60%);"><strong>(a"n")</strong> Spanish additions</span> are highlighted in yellow and tagged with label (a"n"), where "a" stands for addition and "n" refers to the number of the addition. 
    Moreover, with a click on the label in the spaish text, the user sees the corresponding point in the Italian text where the addition occurs, always marked with label (a"n"). 
    The same works the other way around: by clicking the label in the Italian text, the user will see the corresponding addition in the Spanish text.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color:  #c46f71;"><strong>(g"n")</strong>Spanish omissions</span> are highlighted in red and marked with a label (g"n"), where "g" stands for gap and "n" refers to the number of the omission. 
    As for additions, with a click on the label in the spaish text, the user sees the corresponding omitted passage in the Italian text always marked with the label (g"n") together with the omitted text. 
    In the Italian text, the omission is always indicated with (g"n"), followed by the omitted text highlighted in red. Again, the same works the other way around.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color:  #5ce1e6;"><strong>(ab"n")</strong>Spanish Abbreviation</span> are highlighted in cyan and tagged with the label (ab"n").
    Certain names and titles used by Manzoni in Italian have been rendered differently in Gallego’s Spanish translation, often shortened. 
    To clarify the text and help the reader navigate the bilingual comparison, the full names and titles in Italian are highlighted in cyan and preceded by the label (ab"n"), where "ab" stands for abbreviation and "n" refers to the abbreviation number. 
    As with additions and omissions, with a click on the label in Italian, the user discovers the corresponding shortened Spanish appellative, also marked in cyan with the same label (ab"n"). The same works in reverse.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: #cb6ce6; "><strong>(m"n")</strong>Spanish modifications</span> are highlighted in purple and tagged with label (m"n").
    Some passages in the Italian text were not added or omitted in Spanish but modified under the influence of the Spanish context and ideology. 
    These passages are highlighted in purple, with the modified text preceded by the label (m"n") in both texts. 
    As before, with a click on the label in one of the texts, the user sees the corresponding modified passage in the other. </li>
    


  <p>
    <strong>Modifications</strong>, influenced by Spanish context or ideology, shine in purple, with the tag (m"n") linking one version to the other.
  </p>
</ul>
  <p>
    Some of these modifications are even traced back to scholarly studies:
  </p>

  <p>
    Those identified by <em>María de las Nieves Muñiz Muñiz</em>, who examined how <em>I promessi sposi</em> was first received in Spain,
    are tagged (Mm"n"). Hover over the label, and a popup explains the change with a reference to her research.
  </p>

  <p>
    Others, especially at the idiomatic level — where Italian sayings were turned into Spanish ones — were analyzed by
    <em>Beatrice Pecchiari</em>. These are tagged (Im"n"), highlighted in a delicate cucumber shade, and also come with hover-to-explain notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result is a dynamic reading journey. Instead of passively comparing two columns of text, the user actively navigates additions,
    gaps, abbreviations, and subtle shifts in meaning. Each click, each highlight, opens a window onto how a 19th-century Italian masterpiece
    was reshaped for a Spanish-speaking audience.
